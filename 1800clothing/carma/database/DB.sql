His dark, silk vest probably matches the color of his wool coat. The front yoke of his shirt has pleats, and he wears a businessman’s black tie. His hair is receding but full slightly below his ears. Because of glare correction, his dark clothing looks very blue. Large buttonholes continuing up the coat lapel can be faintly seen.

He chose the elegant style of a Chesterfield with a black velvet collar. We are unable to see the buttons but they may have been covered with dark brown heavy silk. His sleeves are fashionably narrow, showing narrow rims of shirt cuffs. The shoulder line is a good demonstration of the lack of padding in men''s shoulders in the 1840s which had emphasized a popular sloping line. With a simple black tie over a pleated-bosom shirt, his vest is actually a darker tone of brown than the coat. It was made of heavy silk, not wool. His trousers were very dark, as was the fashion. Oliver appears taut-skinned, thinner than ever before, and we know he was slowly dying of tuberculosis, as so many people in his generation were. His hair is styled as usual, but is more receding in the 11 years he was away from the body of LDS Church activity, He was not a very large man, and had small boned, graceful hands. The very fine artist, Ken Corbitt, took the liberty to include a bound first copy of The Book of Mormon in the painting.','Painting complements of the artist, Ken Corbitt.

The coat lapels are gently rolled, with large, 1 inch buttons, and follow the 1930s fashion of padding the upper coat to slope from neck to shoulder. He probably has some gathering in the top of the sleeves to make them stand up a bit. His tie is an every-day, black silk in a horizontal bow with pointed ends. His shirt shows pleats as part of the center front yoke of his pull-over, white linen shirt. A button-on collar stands up, stiff with starch, and wraps from the front to the back, where it becomes narrow, only ¾ inch high, allowing buttons and buttonholes. His shirt cuffs properly show at the end of his coat sleeves. Charles’ hair has ample sideburns but nothing on the chin or jaw-line. With gentle waves, it comes down only to the top of his collar in back. Rich was an early and devout follower of Joseph Smith, Jr., and holds an open Book of Mormon.','Oil-painting in the Salt Lake City DUP museum, (artist unknown).'),

He found a 2nd-hand coat without padding in the shoulders, and chose an interesting brocade of black and gold woven together for his vest. The vest had a silky back with a cinch buckle he sewed on. His trousers were sturdy cotton in cream color, with strong muslins for pockets and facings. He also put on correctly smooth white stockings with very simple low shoes of black leather. It was a rare and delightful curiosity to see a wedding like this with a ”country preacher” performing the wedding service. His wife had a pretty ensemble and it all worked out happily.

Mary''s day cap is definitely an 1840 style with ruching on each side of the face and including flower bud decorations. All her hair is in a bun inside the cap. Her dress is covered by a capelet with a light-colored, ruffled edging. A bright plaid ribbon is tied around at her neck and spreads out to show it off. Over her arms is a pale shawl, perhaps a color to match part of the ribbon, These light colors are certainly not all white.

On each cheekbone, his sideburns extend into small "muttonchops" and are bright, curly orange. Bell’s high coat collar in back shows perfectly the way coats were padded to slope sharply from shoulder to neck, as was done in the late 1830s. Part of a button is seen just below the M-cut of his lapel, which would indicate a double-breasted coat. A high, stand up shirt collar of stiff white linen lies against his jawbone, and a white silk tie is wrapped around the collar with not much of a knot in front. Note that the very high collar is cut into a dip in the back to avoid discomfort to neck and hairline. White ruffles spill down the bosom of his shirt.

In the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, (SPNEA¬¬¬¬¬¬¬ in New York City), Carma unloaded, with permission, many long boxes of petticoats from storage. There were all kinds of cotton, linen and silk petticoats, with many beautiful, white wool examples. Wool was much used and when laundered gradually began turning more creamy, and then yellowish. Wherever used, east or west. The Society also preserved some poorer-class petticoats that had padded, quilted hemlines about 10 or 12 inches deep. These were made of scraps of silk from richer households and were sewn together to make a nice, smooth edge on the petticoats, which would help to hold out skirts in a fashionable way. The upper parts of the petticoats were just cheaper muslins, sometimes not fully bleached muslins. But even these helped skirts to stand out properly for humbler women. Waistbands were made of different scraps of plain and figured silks. The petticoats were a joy to see, as I imagined all the fine articles of clothing which seamstresses for the higher classes had given away from their better dresses, ball gowns, cloaks and silk linings, or even silks from men''s tailor''s vests and waistcoats.

At this date there was still fullness at the top of slightly dropped-shoulder sleeves. She was fastidious about her day caps, collars and cuffs. She was by nature a cleanly person, but not given to pretentions. She wears a handsome square brooch from the time of her marriage fastening a small embroidered collar. Her day cap shows pretty flowers made of bits of silky fabrics and wire, which adorn the small ruffles on each side of her face. A chain about her neck was attached to a little, flattened watch tucked into the waistline pocket of her bodice. She cared little about enormous petticoats, for she moved rapidly around in the events of her life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      In 1837 Queen Victoria ascended the British throne and used plaids excessively in silks and Scottish woolens for herself and all her attendants at Balmoral Castle. Soon, plaids in every fiber became more fashionable throughout the English-speaking world and much of Europe. British India was putting out cheap, plaid cotton ginghams by shiploads, bought by the poorest in any British province and American dry goods stores.                                                                                                                                                                                  Patty married at age 17, having grown up in the Maine woods. Highly intelligent, she felt great compassion for others. Becoming a midwife, she had consistent successes in the nearly 4000 births she aided in her lifetime. Pattie''s talented hands were always busy, taking sewing materials along as she waited for babies to be born.                                                                                                 Crossing the plains, she darted in and out of wagons and traveled by horseback even to a company behind or ahead, wherever needed. If scraps were available to make baby clothes, or her own collars and cuffs, she sewed on them in every spare minute. Her husband, David Sessions, helped Patty raise their own large family. She rode horses well, so, for the rest of her life, she rode anywhere to put a mother "to bed." There, she cared for the family until the mother felt well and confident. Patty''s own family became accustomed to having her leave in an instant, no matter where they lived.','LDS Archives. Also From Internet: https://mormonbloke.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/trail-of-hope/'),

Smith''s trousers are cotton/linen of narrow, equal stripes of beige and soft green. They have bottom straps, buttoned under the shoe sole, that hold trousers neatly down on the leg. A vest of mottled beige linen with a shawl collar covers his fine white linen shirt. Small black and gold designs grace the silky cravat which wraps around his standing collar to button in the back. His boots have proper square toes.','The LDS Historic Sites Exhibits made this accurate mannequin and originally put it in Joseph Smith’s Vermont Birthplace Site. However, the clothing was totally incorrect. Later they enlarged the site and asked Carma to make new and better clothes. She dressed him entirely in linen for the hot sticky weather of the Midwest, seated at a Nauvoo table with assorted papers he owned and used. Never before had he been shown wearing proper linen for an Illinois summer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Years later, when this exhibit was exchanged for another, it was all transported to Salt Lake City and warehoused. In the 1980s, Carma desired some of the clothing for display, and the Church gave her the entire mannequin, plus the use of Church furniture. It was placed behind glass in the 2005 Joseph Smith 200th Birthday Exhibit in the Joseph Smith Building on BYU Campus. Carma made all this clothing and used her own 1840s books to display on the table. The exhibit extended to 6 months, allowing 33,000 people to view this scene of 11 dressed mannequins over a summer and into winter. It joined with displays showing men, women and children of Joseph''s entire lifetime (1805-1844).\n    Clothing and hair designed by Carma, and clothing made by Carma.

The linen coat has white piping on all edges, modeled after an authentic white linen Eastern American coat of 1845 in Carma’s collection (seen elsewhere).

Carma chose a cream and black silk tie with tiny figures. The pullover shirt has a front yoke 8 by 10 inches long of box pleating in the white linen. Joseph’s actual hair was dull blond or lightest brown, according to the claims of 19 acquaintances, and had a tiny touch of red. A swatch of hair, clipped from Joseph''s head after his assassination, was held in Carma’s hand, as was Hyrum’s hair.[1] The Prophet''s dear brother''s hair was a dull light brown.

Carma wanted to preserve the mannequin with the furniture to display in other Seminary and Institute buildings in the West. Students and teachers could stand near him for taking memorable photos.

Carma handled the cloak and pulled open the yarns of the lining. There she found that it was not originally brown, but bright green in the early construction of the cloak.The cloak was handed back to the Bills family after Joseph’s death. They wore it for at least another generation during which the outside fabric was torn and heavily mended in different colors of thread.

The march was so miserable that few of the Battalion wanted to talk about it later. Some came immediately, some slowly. Many brought their pay to Brigham Young to sacrifice in aid of other Mormons coming west across the Great Plains.','Costume and photos from a huge informational map researched and printed by Cap Cressup, costume re-enactor, collector and researcher of excellence in Saugus,'),

Her habit is a long skirt and separate bodice with at least 45 tiny (probably silver) buttons sewn onto narrow tape decorations. She favors the military effect. Her jacket collar is turned up and lined with a Betsy Collar from an Empire-high blouse for riding. There are 1840-style epaulette sleeves over her long-narrow ones. The edges of the epaulettes even have buttons and tape on them. Her cuffs expose a white frill at the wrist.                           The left side of her skirt two feet longer at the hemline, which modestly shields her ankles while she is mounted side-saddle. She holds up some excess length, and we can glimpse only the front of her narrow, square-tipped shoe style. (It was considered a titillation of male desire if a man walked near an exposed, easily-touched ankle.) She wears white stockings and black leather slippers with some heel on them to secure the foot in a stirrup. She holds an ivory handled crop, one of two she owned (still in private collections).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Her black silk bonnet was removed and placed on the table so the painter, could capture her profile. The bonnet has a fine, black, silk, lace veil to float behind her while she rides. The inside of the bonnet brim is a flattering shade of pale pink to reflect on her face. Her natural dark hair is pulled back in a high bob, with two sections of hair on the front sides are twisted into ringlets, bound together with small cords to hang in front of her ears with her bonnet on. When this painting is seen close up, as Carma has held it in her hands, it is possible to see sets of combs that keep Emma''s hair smooth on each side of her head, each positioned forward at eyebrow height.

Her clothing is remarkably beautiful: first a tucker or chemisette over the shoulders which was tied around the waist under the dress. Over that is a dress with a deep wide neckline. Then the white silk shoulder shawl with an embroidered collar added. The simple shawl was a fringed square folded in a triangle, with 2 or 4 inch knotted fringe tied from the warp and weft of the fabric itself. Her hollow gold beads had been popular for the previous 20 years in America. The embroidery on the tucker and collar appears to have been hand stitched, though machine embroidery was in high fashion in the 1840s. Small, ordinary home sewing machines were not yet owned by the general population for another 25 years. The triangle points of edge embroidery on the sheer mull or organza collar, are flowers and ferns. The great medallion with geometric band around the neck, were all of the highest quality. Part or all may have been done by Emma herself over a period of time, or by British embroiderers in Nauvoo.

They arrived in New Orleans 1844. The Prophet Joseph Smith was sorry that William died 3 weeks after arrival, leaving Mary with 3 children. Mary gave birth to Emma in May 1844, and the infant quickly died. She bravely purchased 10 acres north of Nauvoo and would not be crushed by the deaths nor assassinations in Nauvoo.

Six inch fringe is down the outer seam of the sleeves.

This calico shirt shows the marks of a good seamstress. There is top-stitching around the front placket, collar and cuffs, as well as top stitching for the shoulder "straps." 
The bottom side splits of the shirt were hand rolled with very close stitches for strength to survive many washings, as well as men jamming the shirt hems inside their pants. A tiny gusset, barely seen in the illustration, strengthens the top of the side split. French seams were employed wherever possible for added strength, and to avoid open seams which would fray.

The narrow sleeves of 1847 have the effect of extra small capelet sleeves at the shoulder, but are really four tucks in the correct position of the sleeve fabric itself. These tucks are echoed the V-shaped tucks which decorate the bodice in front from the shoulder seams to the waistline. \nThere are another four tucks a foot up from the floor in horizontal lines all around the skirt. It does not seem "too much" because of the monochrome fabric, with no other color introduced to the ensemble.
Carma also designed small diameter self- cording around the high V neckline, as well as the diagonal fitting lines of the bodice. More cording attaches the bodice to the skirt, a feature of fine couture. Self-cording ends the sleeve, where a bit of pleated edging adds a crisp touch of white. A large, fine, white, waist apron with folded triangle edges lies across the dress, here, and made additional harmoniously points when worn. A little white day cap was worn over the pioneer''s hair while she played her part in explaining the pioneer cabin to visitors.','Worn by a docent at the oldest cabin in Salt Lake City, as part of the “Pioneer Profiles” of MCHA.

In back of the bonnet is a small bavolet of the same fabric. Slightly darker blue ribbons tie under her chin. All is completely hand-sewn. \nHer white dress is a perfect copy of a dress Carma researched in the collection in the University of Connecticut. There is a shirred center front waistline in V shape of the bodice, and a high round neck. The sleeves are long and narrow and have moderate epaulettes over them sewn into the seams of the armseyes. The skirt is full and has four tucks at the hemline.
All edges of the neck, epaulettes, and sleeves are outlined by narrow, unruffled, white lace She wears two white petticoats, one with a series of ruffles under a plain petticoat to smooth the silhouette of the white dress. Her stockings are white with black slippers. She holds a pink reticule of silky plush with drawstrings of black silk cord, and a parasol of pale pink with multiple lace ruffles around the edges. An authentic corset of the time would have made her modern waistline very tiny.
Her male companion wears a fine black topper of average height, and a black-fronted, silk vest with a thin, white, double-linen back. Inside the vest are no exposed seams at all—in keeping with hundreds of Carma’s views of period vests across the western world. On the back waist of his vest are seven-inch linen flaps with embroidered holes on the edges. 
Attached vertically, they allow a white cord to lace the vest snugly smooth and tight in front (This construction pattern was from the beautifully hand-sewn vest Hyrum Smith wore at his death.)The cream corduroy trousers are described elsewhere.
